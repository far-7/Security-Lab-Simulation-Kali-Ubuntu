# Security+ Lab Simulation â€“ Kali & Ubuntu

This project simulates a small business network environment to demonstrate foundational cybersecurity practices aligned with CompTIA Security+ domains.  
It was conducted in a **virtual lab setup** using Kali Linux (attacker) and Ubuntu (target).

---

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
- **Environment:** UTM with Kali Linux (2025.1) and Ubuntu Server (22.04 LTS)  
- **Objective:** Perform reconnaissance, exploit weak credentials, analyze network traffic, and apply system hardening.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Methodology
1. **Reconnaissance** â€“ Nmap scanning to identify active services.  
2. **Vulnerability Assessment** â€“ Enumeration of open ports and weak SSH configurations.  
3. **Exploitation Simulation** â€“ Brute force SSH login using Hydra.  
4. **Traffic Analysis** â€“ Captured packets with Wireshark during attack phase.  
5. **System Hardening** â€“ Applied UFW firewall rules, disabled root login, enforced password policies.  
6. **Verification** â€“ Re-scanned system to confirm mitigation effectiveness.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Findings
- Weak/default passwords are easily exploitable.  
- Default SSH configurations allow risky root login.  
- Firewall rules significantly reduce the attack surface.

## ðŸ”¹ Skills Demonstrated
- Penetration Testing Basics  
- Network Scanning (Nmap)  
- Password Attacks (Hydra)  
- Traffic Capture & Analysis (Wireshark)  
- Linux Firewall & SSH Hardening  
- CompTIA Security+ Domains
